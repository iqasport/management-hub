## QuickStart Local Development

For local development a database is required, so the following spins up a Postgres Docker Container which runs in the background and seeds it with dummy data.

You will need a `.env` file to set environment variables - use `.env.example` as a template.

1. Start [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/get-started)
2. Run `yarn db:setup` which will start the docker container with Postgres, run migrations and seed the database
3. `yarn install`
4. `yarn dev`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

To tear down the database run `yarn docker:down`
