## QuickStart Local Development

The following guide spins up a local environment for development, with an up-to-date Postgres database seeded with dummy data running in the background. Each step must be completed before moving on to the next one.

### Prequisites

This project assumes you already have a Node evironment setup and have yarn installed. We strongly recommend using a Node Version Manager like [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm). You will also need to have [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/get-started)

You will need a `.env` file to set environment variables - duplicate `.env.example` and rename the copy to `.env` to get started.

### Steps

1. Start Docker Desktop - this can take a few minutes
2. In your terminal go in to the management-hub folder (where this file is) and run `yarn install`
3. In the same folder run `yarn db:setup` which will start the docker container with Postgres, run migrations and seed the database
4. Finally run `yarn dev` in the same folder

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the application.

To tear down the database run `yarn docker:down`. To reinitialise simply run steps 3 & 4 again.
